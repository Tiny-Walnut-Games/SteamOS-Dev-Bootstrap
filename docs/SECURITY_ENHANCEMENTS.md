# Security Enhancements

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented in the SteamOS Development Bootstrap project.

## Security Improvements

### 1. Secure Download Functions

Added a comprehensive set of security helper functions in `scripts/security/secure_download.sh`:

- `validate_url()`: Validates URLs before downloading, ensuring they use HTTPS and come from trusted domains
- `secure_download()`: Downloads files with proper TLS settings
- `verify_checksum()`: Verifies file integrity using SHA-256 checksums
- `safe_execute()`: Safely executes scripts after validation

These functions have been integrated into the bootstrap script to replace unsafe pipe-to-shell patterns.

### 2. Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline Security

The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated with comprehensive security scanning:

- **Secret Detection**: Scans for accidentally committed secrets
- **Unsafe Pattern Detection**: Identifies pipe-to-shell patterns and other unsafe practices
- **Insecure Certificate Validation**: Checks for disabled certificate validation
- **Credential Detection**: Looks for potential hardcoded credentials

### 3. Docker Security Improvements

The Dockerfile has been updated with security best practices:

- **Specific Version Tag**: Uses a specific version tag instead of `latest`
- **Non-Root User**: Runs as a non-root user
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Installs only necessary packages
- **Secure Environment Defaults**: Sets secure environment variables

### 4. Security Documentation

Added comprehensive security documentation:

- **Security Guidelines**: Created `docs/SECURITY.md` with security best practices
- **CI/CD Pipeline Documentation**: Added security-focused sections to `docs/CI_CD_PIPELINE.md`
- **Secure Installation Instructions**: Updated README.md with secure installation options

### 5. Security Audit Tools

Added security audit tools to help maintain security:

- **Security Audit Script**: Created `scripts/security/security_audit.sh` to check for common security issues
- **Secure Bootstrap Script**: Created `scripts/secure_bootstrap.sh` to update the bootstrap script with security functions

## Security Best Practices

The following security best practices have been implemented:

1. **HTTPS Only**: All downloads use HTTPS with proper TLS settings
2. **Input Validation**: URLs and other inputs are validated before use
3. **File Integrity**: Files are verified with checksums when possible
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Docker containers and scripts use minimal permissions
5. **Secure Defaults**: Secure defaults are used throughout the project
6. **Documentation**: Security practices are well-documented

## Future Security Improvements

Consider implementing these additional security improvements:

1. **Signed Releases**: Sign releases with GPG keys
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Add dependency scanning to the CI/CD pipeline
3. **Container Scanning**: Add container scanning to the CI/CD pipeline
4. **Security Policy**: Create a formal security policy
5. **Vulnerability Disclosure Process**: Establish a vulnerability disclosure process
